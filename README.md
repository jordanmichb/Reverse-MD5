## Reverse-MD5

This application will take an MD5 value like "81dc9bdb52d04dc20036dbd8313ed055" (the MD5 for the string "1234") and check all combinations of four-digit "PIN" numbers to see if any of those PINs produce the given hash.

A second page is included where the user can enter a value and generate an MD5 hash.
